Princeton Blue was failing to effectively reach decision-makers at target pharma and biotech companies like J\u0026J and Eli Lilly. This had to be fixed.\nCurrent-state Audit After auditing and brainstorming, we discovered the following:\nAudits revealed that emails were never reaching the prospects inbox due to stringent email firewall systems at target accounts. Email validations included catch-all emails that were never seen by the recipient For those emails that did pass the firewall, they were in a holding area with bot opens and bot clicks. The recipient never actually got to see the emais. The email metrics were inaccurate. Cold calling did not work since the agency did not understand what they were actually selling. The agency had no defined plan to fix this problem and continued iterating on the same. Our Strategic Solution We proposed the idea to use Pramod's LinkedIn account coupled with Sales Navigator to drive MQLs through a targeted content strategy program.\nLinkedIn Sales Navigator was used effectively to find contacts based on the target ICP at accounts that Princeton Blue wanted to target.\nStrategic Networking: Leveraged Sales Navigator to identify and connect with decision-makers at target companies. Connection-First Strategy: Sent personalized connection requests to build a relevant network. Value-First Content: Developed posts highlighting Princeton Blue's process automation expertise in pharma/biotech. Innovative Content Formats: Utilized engaging formats like \"Shortcasts\" (short audio/video casts) to capture attention and drive interaction. Consistent Cadence: Established a regular posting schedule optimized for the LinkedIn algorithm. Industry-Specific Messaging: Crafted content addressing challenges in Clinical, Regulatory, Lab, and Manufacturing processes. The Transformation: Results After 90 Days 32 ➔ 328 Avg.

Key Companies Engaged: Employees from target organizations like J\u0026J and Eli Lilly. Key Takeaway for Busy Founders This case study demonstrates that B2B lead generation requires out-of-the-box thinking in applying the right channel to target the right prospects. Strategic connections, targeted value-first content, and innovative formats like Shortcasts are paramount, leading to tangible business outcomes like lead generation - possible easily via LinkedIn - the solution of choice for this challenge. The Sales Navigator connection strategy was particularly effective: as target executives accepted connection requests, they began seeing Princeton Blue's content in their feeds, creating regular exposure without demanding constant outreach. Pramod now enjoys consistent LinkedIn growth with minimal time investment, positioning Princeton Blue as a thought leader in process automation for pharma/biotech and creating a valuable channel for business development with enterprise clients, evidenced by significant lead generation and CLV.
